Visual Circuit is an **open source** tool to develop robotic applications. It aims to make developing applications for ROS and Gazebo simple and user friendly by its intuitive block-based interface. Users have the abliity to drag and drop blocks to develop their logic. Users are also able to build completely custom blocks as well as edit code in the existing blocks, this makes Visual Circuit a robust and powerful tool to develop even complicated applications.
